# AdmissionManagementSystem
The Admission Management System is a C++ based application designed to efficiently manage student admission records. The system provides functionalities to add, edit, delete, search, and display student data. It stores essential student details such as serial number, name, age, branch, session, Aadhaar number, and contact details in a text file.

It allows users to:

1. Add New Student Details: Input details like name, age, branch, and other information.
2. Edit Student Data: Modify existing records by entering the serial number and updated details.
3. Search Student Data: Find records by entering keywords like name or serial number.
4. Display All Data: View all student records stored in a text file.
5. Delete Student Data: Remove records by specifying the line number.

Data is stored in `Student.txt`, and basic error handling is included for file access and invalid inputs. The system offers a simple menu for easy navigation and record management.
